# parceledApp

Purpose of this project was to search for addresses and locate houses, I created this POC using a public API where it lists details of addresses and to demonstrate the location I used a mapview embed so that it was not necessary to use google keys. In a real project, I would use maps natively or using a third-party library.

In addition, it was necessary to place some static information such as photos and values so that they could meet the test requirements.
